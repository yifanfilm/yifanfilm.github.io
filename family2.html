            <p>Lola was adopted into a Belgian family eleven years ago when she was an infant. Over the years,
                she has been imagining the reunion with her birth family in China. This summer, her dream finally
                comes true. When Lola's two families finally meet for the first time, how will they spend the time
                together? What will Lola's birth parents tell her?
